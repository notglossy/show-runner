Self-hosted dashboard kiosk for rooted Amazon Echo Show 8 devices running Android. A thin Android
app shows one full-screen WebView; a Next.js server on your LAN decides what every screen shows,
so you can design screens in a browser and never touch the device again.

Currently built for one household: a single admin user, a single shared device secret. Only the Echo Show 8 (2nd gen, LineageOS 18.1 / Android 11) is tested.

## How it works

The device registers with the server, loads `/device/<id>`, and obeys server-sent events
(`reload`, `navigate`, `refreshData`). A **screen** is an HTML/CSS/JS template stored in the
database; the server renders it and injects a small runtime that exposes live data as
`window.kiosk.data` and fills `data-bind` attributes. **Playlists** rotate screens on a dwell
timer. **Providers** (time, weather via Open-Meteo) supply the data. Details, diagram and
request flow: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Features

- Pairing by on-screen code; claim, name and assign devices from the dashboard.
- Launcher kiosk mode by default; optional strict mode (device owner + lock task) that can always
  be left from the on-device exit menu or the dashboard, never by factory reset.
- Screen editor with a live 1280×800 preview and four built-in screens (Default, pictured above;
  clock; clock + weather; and an analog dial).
- AI screen generation from a description through any OpenAI-compatible API (optional).
- Playlists, per-device commands, device logs and heartbeat status in the dashboard.

## Quick start

You need Docker on a machine on the same LAN as the display, and adb for the one-time device
install.

1. **Configure the server.** The server ships as a container image,
   `ghcr.io/notglossy/showrunner`, built for amd64 and arm64 by every
   [release](https://github.com/notglossy/showrunner/releases). The image is public, so no
   registry login is needed. You only need the compose file and an `.env`:

   ```sh
   mkdir showrunner && cd showrunner
   curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notglossy/showrunner/main/docker-compose.yml
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notglossy/showrunner/main/.env.example -o .env
   # edit .env: set ADMIN_PASSWORD; SHOWRUNNER_VERSION picks the release (see Configuration)
   ```

2. **Run it.**

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   Open `http://<server-lan-ip>:3000`, log in with `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Health check:
   `/api/health`. The SQLite database lives on the `showrunner-data` volume. To update, change
   `SHOWRUNNER_VERSION` and run `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. Match the app
   version on the display to the server version: a release carries both.

3. **Prepare the display** once, following [docs/device-setup.md](docs/device-setup.md):
   enable adb, then install the app with the server address and secret. Use the APK from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/notglossy/showrunner/releases), or drop `--apk` to build it
   yourself with Android Studio's JDK:

   ```sh
   scripts/install.sh --apk showrunner-<version>.apk --server http://<server-lan-ip>:3000 --secret "$DEVICE_SHARED_SECRET" --home
   ```

   Leave out `--secret` if the server has no `DEVICE_SHARED_SECRET`; then open **Add a display** in the
   dashboard so the display can register.

   The display shows a pairing code. In the dashboard, open **Devices**, claim the code and give
   the device a name. It starts on the built-in Default screen.

4. **Make screens.** Edit the built-in screens or write new ones in the editor. The template
   contract is [docs/screen-authoring.md](docs/screen-authoring.md). Set `AI_API_KEY` to
   generate screens from a description.

## Configuration

Everything is environment variables, read by `docker compose` from `.env`.

## Development

Server: Node 22 and pnpm 10 (`corepack enable`). To run the container from your checkout instead
of the released image: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d`.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev      # http://localhost:3000
pnpm check    # format, lint, typecheck, tests with coverage, build
```

Android: open `apps/android` in Android Studio, or from the shell with its bundled JDK:

```sh
cd apps/android
./gradlew assembleDebug          # APK
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest      # JVM unit tests, no device needed
```
