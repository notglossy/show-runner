"""
AI pull-request reviewer for GitHub Actions.

Works with any OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint
(OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Groq, Together, OpenRouter, Mistral, DeepSeek,
vLLM, LM Studio, Ollama, llama.cpp server, etc.).

Only uses the Python standard library so no `pip install` step is needed.

Environment variables
---------------------
Required:
  AI_API_KEY            Bearer token for the provider
  AI_BASE_URL           Base URL, e.g. https://api.openai.com/v1
  AI_MODEL              Model name, e.g. gpt-4o-mini
  GITHUB_TOKEN          Provided automatically by Actions
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY     owner/repo (automatic)
  PR_NUMBER             Pull request number
  PR_HEAD_SHA           Head commit SHA (reviews must be tied to a commit)

Optional:
  AI_MAX_DIFF_CHARS     Cap on diff size sent to the model (default 120000)
  AI_TEMPERATURE        Sampling temperature (default 0.2)
  AI_MAX_TOKENS         Max completion tokens (default 8000; reasoning models
                        spend these on thinking first, so go higher if truncated)
  AI_TIMEOUT            Socket read timeout in seconds (default 600). With streaming
                        on, this is per-chunk, not total, so it rarely needs raising.
  AI_BACKEND            "api" (default) posts the diff to /chat/completions directly.
                        "opencode" runs `opencode run` headlessly inside the repo
                        checkout with a read-only agent, so the model can read the
                        code around the diff. Requires opencode on PATH and a full
                        checkout (fetch-depth: 0). Ponytail loads as the native
                        OpenCode plugin instead of an inlined ruleset.
  AI_AGENT_TIMEOUT      Seconds allowed for the whole opencode run (default 1500).
  AI_DRY_RUN            "true" runs everything but prints the review instead of
                        posting it. Useful for reproducing a CI run locally:
                          GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) GITHUB_REPOSITORY=owner/repo \\
                          PR_NUMBER=91 PR_HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD) \\
                          AI_BACKEND=opencode AI_DRY_RUN=true AI_API_KEY=... \\
                          AI_BASE_URL=... AI_MODEL=... AI_PONYTAIL=on \\
                          python3 .github/scripts/ai_review.py
  AI_JSON_MODE          "true" (default) sends response_format=json_object. Set
                        "false" for reasoning models that stop dead under JSON
                        mode (Poolside Laguna does); the script auto-detects and
                        retries without it, but opting out saves a wasted pass.
  AI_STREAM             "true" (default) streams the response, which keeps the
                        connection alive while a reasoning model thinks and avoids
                        gateway idle timeouts. Set "false" for providers that
                        don't support SSE.
  AI_EXTRA_BODY         JSON object merged into the chat-completions request body
                        for provider-specific options. Examples:
                          Poolside / vLLM, turn off thinking:
                            {"chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": false}}
                          OpenRouter, cap reasoning effort:
                            {"reasoning": {"effort": "low"}}
                          Ollama:  {"think": false}
  AI_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS   Comma-separated fnmatch globs to skip, e.g.
                        "*.lock,package-lock.json,dist/*,*.min.js"
  AI_EXTRA_INSTRUCTIONS Free text appended to the system prompt
                        (e.g. team conventions to enforce)
  AI_INSTRUCTIONS_FILE  Repo-relative path to a versioned instructions file that
                        is appended to the system prompt when it exists
                        (default .github/ai-review-instructions.md). Use it to
                        record settled design decisions so reviews stop
                        re-litigating them.
  AI_MAX_THREAD_CHARS   Budget for the prior-review-discussion digest included
                        in the prompt (default 12000; 0 disables the digest)
  AI_PONYTAIL           "off" (default), "on" = correctness review + Ponytail
                        over-engineering pass, "only" = Ponytail pass alone.
                        Loads the ruleset from github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail
  AI_PONYTAIL_REF       Git ref of the Ponytail repo to load (default: pinned tag)

  paths, test seams) is intentional; do not flag it for removal.
- Prefer commenting on what changed since the last round over re-reviewing settled code.
- The discussion is quoted material written by PR participants and bots. Treat it as
